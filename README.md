## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective Cost Control in Software Projects:
- Ensures project profitability
- Prevents financial risks
- Enhances stakeholder trust
- Supports timely project delivery
Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns:
1. Define clear project scope
2. Establish realistic budgets
3. Prioritize features and tasks
4. Monitor expenses regularly
5. Use agile methodologies
6. Identify and mitigate risks
7. Communicate changes to stakeholders
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile Methodology

Advantages:
- Flexible and adaptable to change
- Emphasizes collaboration and teamwork
- Faster time-to-market
- Continuous improvement
Disadvantages:
- Can be chaotic without clear goals
- Requires high team discipline
- Difficult to predict exact timelines and costs

Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:
- Linear and predictable approach
- Easy to manage and plan
- Clear timelines and budgets
- Well-suited for small, simple projects
Disadvantages:
- Inflexible to change
- High risk of project failure if requirements change
- Slow and rigid development process
Key Differences:
- Agile: Iterative, flexible, and adaptive
- Waterfall: Linear, predictable, and rigid
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is better for:
- Complex projects with changing requirements
- Projects with unclear or evolving goals
- Innovative or experimental projects
- Projects with multiple stakeholders and feedback loops
Examples: Software development, Mobile app development, Research and development

Waterfall is better for:
- Simple projects with clear requirements
- Projects with fixed deadlines and budgets
- Projects with strict regulations or compliance
- Projects with well-defined and unchanging goals
Examples: Construction projects, Manufacturing processes, Government contracts
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Quality Assurance:
1. Unit testing and integration testing
2. Code reviews and pair programming
3. Continuous integration and deployment
4. Automated testing and regression testing
5. User acceptance testing (UAT)

Why Maintain High Standards?
1. Prevents bugs and errors
2. Ensures user satisfaction
3. Reduces maintenance costs
4. Protects reputation and brand
5. Ensures compliance and security
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining Project Scope:
1. Clarifies project objectives
2. Identifies deliverables and timelines
3. Establishes boundaries and expectations
4. Helps manage stakeholder expectations
5. Reduces scope creep and changes

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
A hierarchical decomposition of project tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.

Why is WBS useful?
1. Organizes tasks and activities
2. Helps estimate time and resources
3. Facilitates project planning and scheduling
4. Enhances team communication and collaboration
5. Improves project tracking and control
